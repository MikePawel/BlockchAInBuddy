## How it works

### 1. Extensive Paper Research

First, a research phase on scientific papers related to blockchain and Web3 technologies was fed to the AI assistant. This phase ensures a robust foundation, allowing the platform to provide credible and up-to-date information to users at all skill levels.

### 2. AI Assistant Pre-Prompting

Users interact with the AI-driven chatbot, based on ChatGPT, by prompting it with queries and requests. To tailor responses to different skill levels, the assistant undergoes specific training for beginners, intermediates, and experts. The training involves understanding how to best assist users based on their proficiency.

### 3. Prompting in Runtime
The AI dynamically adjusts its responses in real-time based on the user's proficiency level. Whether the user is a beginner seeking fundamental knowledge, an intermediate user exploring specific topics, or an expert delving into advanced discussions, BlockchAIn Buddy tailors its interactions to meet the user's specific learning needs.

This approach ensures that the chatbot is well-trained for every user's knowledge level, providing skill-level tailored answers and fostering a personalized learning experience.
